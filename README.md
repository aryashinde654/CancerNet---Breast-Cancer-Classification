# CancerNet - Breast Cancer Histopathology Image Classifier

## 📊 Project Overview
CancerNet is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model built to classify breast cancer histopathology images as **benign** or **malignant**. The model leverages deep learning techniques to assist in the early detection of **Invasive Ductal Carcinoma (IDC)**, which is the most common form of breast cancer.

This project demonstrates how AI can be applied in the medical field to aid pathologists in faster and more accurate diagnosis.
